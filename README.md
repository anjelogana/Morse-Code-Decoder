In my VHDL design, I employed Look-Up Tables (LUTs) and D-Flip-Flop Registers to precisely identify alphanumeric letters corresponding to Morse Code sequences. 
These results were then displayed on a 7-segment display. By implementing sequential logic, I effectively controlled the clock and processed switch signals, enabling the generation and interpretation of Morse Code. 
Using VHDL programming in tools such as iCEcube2 and Lattice Diamond Programmer, I successfully programmed an FPGA to interact with switches, LEDs, and the 7-segment display, facilitating seamless input and output operations.
